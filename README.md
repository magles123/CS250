## Sprint Review and Retrospective

### Interpreting User Needs and Implementing Them into a Program
Understanding user needs is a critical aspect of software development. I achieve this by gathering requirements, analyzing feedback, and translating these needs into functional requirements. Creating **user stories** helps break down complex needs into manageable tasks that guide development. User stories ensure that the program aligns with user expectations and provides a structured way to track progress through Agile methodologies.

### Approach to Developing Programs and Agile Processes
My approach to development follows an iterative and incremental model, incorporating Agile principles such as **Scrum** and **Kanban**. I prioritize tasks based on user needs, ensure continuous integration, and adapt to changes throughout the development process. In my future work, I plan to incorporate Agile practices like **daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives** to improve collaboration, efficiency, and code quality.

### Being a Good Team Member in Software Development
Effective teamwork is essential in software development. I strive to be a good team member by actively communicating, sharing knowledge, and contributing to problem-solving. Collaboration tools like **GitHub, Jira, and Slack** help streamline communication and version control. Additionally, providing constructive feedback and being open to learning from others strengthens team cohesion and project success.
